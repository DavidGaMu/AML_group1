The project aims at empirically studying the effect of multi-level curriculum learning on continual learning, by checking average accuracy, forgetting factor and learning speed. 
The data pool would be of increasing complexity, starting by mnist, then cifar-10 and finally cifar-100. 
The continual learning method would be LwF, and the multi-level curriculum learning would be divided in task ordering and data ordering. For task ordering the methods would be difficulty based, similarity based and adaptive sequencing. For sample ordering the methods would be easy to hard, confidence bias and self-paced.
