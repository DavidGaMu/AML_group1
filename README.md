# Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive empirical investigation into the interaction between Continual Learning (CL) and Curriculum Learning (CurL). While CL methods such as Learning without Forgetting (LwF), Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), and replay-based approaches have shown promise in mitigating catastrophic forgetting, they typically overlook sample ordering within tasks. Concurrently, CurL strategies explicitly manipulate data sequencing to optimize learning trajectories. We systematically evaluate three representative CL algorithms under multiple curriculum strategies: heuristic-based, self-paced, and teacher-driven curricula. Our study aims to quantify the impact of curriculum design on CL performance. Results demonstrate how curriculum strategies can significantly influence CL dynamics.
